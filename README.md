## Description

This project presents the development of a complete ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) pipeline designed to process, analyze, and deliver insights on leukemia-related risk factors across various global regions. This project used a dataset extracted from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ankushpanday1/leukemia-cancer-risk-prediction-dataset?resource=download) containing leukemia-related health data, which 143,194 patient records from 22 different countries.

The technologies used are:

- *Python* → Core programming language used throughout the project for data extraction, transformation, validation, and integration tasks.
- *Jupyter Notebook* → For the execution and documentation of Python code.
- *PostgreSQL* → Used as the central DB for storing the processed data in a dimensional model optimized for analytical queries.
- *Airflow* → Served as the orchestrator of the ETL pipeline, managing task dependencies and automating the data flow from extraction to loading.
- *PowerBI Desktop* → Used to design and publish interactive dashboards that visualize key leukemia risk indicators and regional trends.
- *Great Expectations* → Integrated into the pipeline to enforce data quality through expectations on schema, null values, ranges, and distributions.
- *Kafka* → Implemented to enable real-time data streaming, allowing a live feed of key leukemia metrics to be consumed and visualized dynamically.

The dependencies used in python are in a `requirements.txt` file

## 🛠️ Setup Instructions

### Clone the repository

Execute the following command to clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/valentinabc19/Leukemia-Cancer-Risk-ETL.git

```
> From this point on all processes are done in Visual Studio Code

### Create Virtual Environment
```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
```

### Credentials
To make a connection to the database you must have the database credentials in a JSON file called credentials. So this file must be created in the project folder, with the following syntax:

```bash
{
    "db_host": "DB_HOST",
    "db_name": "DB_NAME",
    "db_user": "DB_USER",
    "db_password": "DB_PASSWORD",
    "db_port": "DB_PORT"    
}
```
Ensure this file is included in `.gitignore`.

### Installing the dependencies
The necessary dependencies are stored in a file named requirements.txt. To install the dependencies you can use the command
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 4. Configure Airflow

```bash
export AIRFLOW_HOME=$(pwd)/airflow
airflow db init
airflow webserver --port 8080
airflow scheduler
```

## 🚀 Usage

### Initialize kafka

Open a terminal in Visual Studio Code and start docker
```bash
docker-compose up -d --build
```

Use this command to see the containers that are running
```bash
docker ps
```

Select the ID of the kafka container and open the bash of this one
```bash
docker exec -it ID bash
```

Run this command to iniatilize the consumer
```bash
kafka-console-consumer --bootstrap-server IDContainer:9092 --topic fact_table --from-beginning
```

### Initialize Airflow

Run this command to initialize airflow
```bash
airflow standalone
```

### Access Airflow UI

Open your browser and go to [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080).  
Use the credentials given to you in Airflow standalone runtime, for example:  
- **Username**: `airflow`  
- **Password**: `airflow`

### Trigger the DAG

- Locate the `leukemia_etl` DAG.
- Turn it **On** and click **"Trigger DAG"**.

### Monitor the Pipeline

- Use the Airflow UI to track task status.
- Logs are available under `airflow/logs/`.

### Output

- The data send to the consumer in turn is sent to a dashboard in Streamlit, which can be accessed by [http://localhost:8501](http://localhost:8501)
